Our analysis firm was tasked with an assignment from a prominent chain
of liquor stores in the state of Iowa. Through our work with this firm,
we were asked to conduct an analysis of liquor sales to determine
whether it would be a smarter business decision to invest in stock of
high-end or low-end liquor in the firmâ€™s stores. We used sales data from
the firm combined with socioeconomic data from the American Community
Survey to determine if income is in any way related to liquor sales. Our
theory is that if high-income communities make up a larger portion of
the liquor sales, the firm should stock more high-end liquor brands to
appeal too that clientele. If low-income communities consumer more
liquor, the firm should invest in the low-end liquor brands. In order to
have more direction for this decision, we have decided to answer the
following questions:

-   Do geographies with higher median income consume more alcohol in
    total?
-   Does it change if we look at per-capita sales?
-   Does the result vary among liquor categories?

As economists, we will look at the correlation between the income of the
state of Iowa and the total sales of liquor in dollars. Based on the
correlation between sales and income dynamics, we will make a policy
recommendation for the firm regarding which class of liquor they should
stock. This decision will also have a benefit to the community as the
products that are sold will be more tailored to the income demographic
of the area. This should increase the quality of living and allow for
the business to prosper no matter which demographic is highly
correlated.

### Data Summary

To answer our research question and provide our recommendation, we
utilized two datasets. First, we used a dataset on liquor sales in Iowa,
which included variables on sales in both dollars and volume across
liquor categories. The dataset is typically used for market research and
analysis to gain insight into consumer behavior, preferences, and
trends. The second dataset we utilized came from the American Community
Survey \[ACS\] and include demographic and socioeconomic variables for
regions across the state of Iowa, including racial variables, education
indicators, and median income. Both datasets were measured across three
different geographic metrics: counties, cities, and zipcodes. We merged
these two datasets across each geographic metric, resulting in three
data frames that included liquor sales and demographic data for Iowa
counties, cities, and zipcodes. The goal of the inclusion of demographic
and economic data was to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the
factors that may influence alcohol sales.

By using the demographic and economic data as independent variables and
the sales data as dependent, we can view and analyze the relationship
between the socioeconomic factors and liquor consumption. In this
particular case, we are looking for a correlation between income levels
and alcohol sales across the different geographic metrics.

Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data and identify
patterns or trends in liquor sales. We use measures of central tendency
(e.g., mean, median) and measures of variables (e.g., sales, geographic
range, and revenue) to provide a general understanding of the data set
and identify any potential outliers or significant trends.

We provided descriptive statistics for the three data frames that
resulted from the merging of the data. One point to note is the
difference in the number of observations between the three data frames.
Since we are looking at three different geographic metrics, there are
differences in the number of observations of the three groups.

One of the limitations of this dataset for our research is that it is a
general view of liquor sales across the whole state and does not provide
information on where the sales are occurring. Since we are focused on a
particular chain of liquor stores, using the data may not provide the
most applicable and accurate results. The relationship between
socioeconomic factors and alcohol sales may vary depending on the
location of the store. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and
consider this limitations of the data when conducting the analysis. We
should also attempt to collect additional data, such as store location
information and sales from this particular chain, to improve the
accuracy and ablicability of our analysis and recommendation.

### Data Analytics

To determine our policy recommendation, we created a series of
visualizations of the data. We analyzed each data set independently and
then merged the data sets to answer our research questions.

We first looked at the Iowa Liquor Sales data. Across each geographic
metric, we created map visualizations that show the total dollar sales
of liquor. We also looked into the areas with the top and bottom dollar
sales. Since our research parameters specified to look across
geographies, we included analysis of all geographic metrics despite
showing similar results in each.

![](county_sales_dynamics.png)


The above visualization displays dynamics of sales across the county
metric. The map shows that the majority of counties have a similar
amount of sales with a few outliers - notably, the counties that
represent the top and bottom sellers.


![](City_sales_dynamics.png) 

There appears to be more variance in sales across the city geographic
level than the county level. Between the two graphs, there is expected
overlap with top selling cities laying within top selling counties.
Notably, the top selling county contains the top selling capital city,
Des Moines.

![](Zipcode_map.png)

The total sales by zipcodes are shown in the map above. This view gives
a more detailed view of the sale dynamics across the state of Iowa. One
noteworthy point from this map is the small geographic area that covers
the top selling region of the state, Des Moines. One recommendation for
the liquor store firm would be to target the Des Moines market if not
already doing so.

Within the liquor sales data, we were also interested in the dynamics of
sales between the different liquor categories.

![](Category_sales_dynamics.png)

The top two selling liquors, whisky and vodka, account for over half of all the sales across the state. This
makes these two liquors especially important to the analysis. The
ranking of category sales in dollars and volume are identical except for
the reversal of gin and brandy between the two. Gin comprises less of
the total sales in dollars than it does of total sales in volume, which
shows that it is likely a cheaper liquor.

Since we used the income data from the American Community Survey, we
analyzed income across the geographic metrics.
