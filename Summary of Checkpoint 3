#As a group, we utilized the data in both R and Tableau. In R, we evaluated the ACS data and created scatter plots that illustrated the relationship between income and the total sales in dollars and volume. OVerall, there were no significant correlation between these variables. After converting some of the scales to logarithms, we still were not able to locate a significant correlation for income and total sales. We are currently playing with the different variables to locate a relationshp.#
Utilizing Tableau we have added geographical maps to illlustrate concentration of incomes and total sales. We have combined the data between the two data sets to see for any relations but we are having toruble figuring out a way to combine both tableu info and R code for our final presentation.
