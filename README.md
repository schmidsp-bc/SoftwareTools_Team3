Repository for team 3's final project
 This file is 3. Sales data analysis visualizations by check point#1. 
 We use three dashboards to analyze sales data. In the first dashboard, we show the sales ranking of the different varieties of wine. The top three sales categories are Whiskey, Vodka, and Rum. The second dashboard shows the top 5 counties and top 10 cities in terms of sales. The third one shows the liquor sales in terms of geographical location. If we select a city, we are also able to see the top five most popular liquor categories in that city.
